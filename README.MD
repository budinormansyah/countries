## üöÄ Setup & Usage

Since this project uses a remote API call (`fetch()`), you must run the file using a local web server to bypass browser security restrictions (CORS/File Protocol).

### 1. Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- A method to run a local server (e.g., VS Code's **Live Server** extension, Python's `http.server`, or similar).

### 2. Installation Steps

1.  Save the provided code as an `index.html` file.
2.  (Optional but Recommended) Ensure you have a local server running.
3.  Open the `index.html` file through your local server.
4.  The application will automatically fetch and display the country data.

### 3. Interacting with the App

1.  **Search:** Use the input field at the top to filter the results.
2.  **View Details:** Click any country card to open the modal and see details like Population, Languages, Timezones, and official names.
3.  **Close Modal:** Click the `&times;` button or click outside the modal overlay.

## üé® Design and Responsiveness

| :------------------ | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------- |

| **Background**      | `#EBEFF2`  | Soft Gray (Page Background).                   |
| **Currency Symbol** | `#779B5D`  | Soft Green (Highlighting currency symbols).    |

The layout is fully **responsive**, adjusting the grid columns and modal content size to ensure excellent usability on screens ranging from small smartphones up to large desktops.
